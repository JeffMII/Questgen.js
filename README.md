# Questgen.js
This project is based on the Questgen.ai Python package originally developed by Ramsri Goutham Golla. The Questgen.js project is has been started as a CS Master's course project in Research Methods. My goal is to not only learn in depth how Questgen.ai was implemented but also to migrate the Python project to JavaScript with both website and Node.js compatibility. The project will focus on specific features and implementations of Questgen.ai in an incremental and deployable manner until the project either meets or surpasses the original Questgen.ai project in functionality.
