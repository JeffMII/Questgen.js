# Questgen.js
###### based on [Questgen.ai](https://github.com/ramsrigouthamg/Questgen.ai) by [Ramsri Goutham Golla](https://github.com/ramsrigouthamg)

## Overview
This project is based on the Questgen.ai Python project originally developed by Ramsri Goutham Golla. The Questgen.js project has been started as my CS Master's course project in Research Methods. My goal is not only to learn in depth how Questgen.ai and its dependencies work, but also to migrate the Python project to JavaScript with both website and Node.js compatibility. The project will focus on specific features and implementations of Questgen.ai in an incremental and deployable manner until, in the long run, the project either meets or surpasses the original Questgen.ai project in functionality.

## Tasks (will be updated with project progression):
<details>
  ```md
    - [ ] Research JavaScript Dependency Equivalents
    - [ ] Create an Itemized List of JavaScript Dependency Equivalents
    - [ ] Study and Understand the Individual Features of Questgen.ai 
    - [ ] Create an Itemized List of Questgen.ai Features to be Implemented \(only a few of these will be used for my Research Methods course project)
  ```
